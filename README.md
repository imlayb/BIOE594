# Eigenfaces

The 1991 article *Eigenfaces for Recognition* was formative for the multimedia research fields [Turk 1991](http://www.face-rec.org/algorithms/pca/jcn.pdf). The dataset, which predates the *Eigenfaces for Recognition* article, has since become a benchmark for computer vision and machine learning.


The data consists of 3993 pictures of human faces at a resolution of 128 x 128 in 8-bit grayscale. Data can be obtained from [MIT](http://courses.media.mit.edu/2004fall/mas622j/04.projects/faces/).
